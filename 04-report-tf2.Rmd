## Introduction

In this tutorial we will build a deep learning model to classify words. We will use [`tfdatasets`](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tools/tfdatasets/articles/introduction.html) to handle data IO and pre-processing, and [Keras](https://keras.rstudio.com) to build and train the model.

We will use the [Speech Commands dataset](https://storage.cloud.google.com/download.tensorflow.org/data/speech_commands_v0.01.tar.gz) which consists of 65.000 one-second audio files of people saying 30 different words. Each file contains a single spoken English word. The dataset was released by Google under CC License.

Our model was first implemented in [*Simple Audio Recognition* at the TensorFlow documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/audio_recognition#top_of_page) which in turn was inpired by [*Convolutional Neural Networks for Small-footprint Keyword Spotting*](http://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2015/papers/i15_1478.pdf). There are other approaches, like [recurent neural networks](https://svds.com/tensorflow-rnn-tutorial/), [dilated (atrous) convolutions](https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/) or [Learning from Between-class Examples for Deep Sound Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10282).

The model we implement here is not the state of the art for audio recognition systems, which are way more complex, but is relatively simple and fast to train.

## Audio representation

Many deep learning models are end-to-end, i.e. we let the model learn useful representations directly from the raw data but, audio data grows very fast - 16,000 samples per second with a very rich structure at many time-scales. In order to avoid raw wave sound data, researchers usually use some kind of feature engineering.

Every sound wave can be represented by it's spectrum, and digitally it can be computed using the [Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform).

A common way to represent audio data is to break it into small chunks, which usualy overlap. For each chunk we use the FFT to calculate the magnitude of the frequency spectrum. The spectrums are then combined, side by side, to form what we call a [spectrogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram). 

It's also common for speech recognition systems to further transform the spectrum and compute the [Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel-frequency_cepstrum). This transformation takes into account that the human ear can't discern the difference between two closely spaced frequencies and smartly creates bins in the frequency axis. A great tutorial on MFCC's can be found [here](http://practicalcryptography.com/miscellaneous/machine-learning/guide-mel-frequency-cepstral-coefficients-mfccs/).

After this procedure, we have an image for each audio sample and we can use convolutional neural networks that are usual in image recognition models. 

## Downloading

First, let's download data to a directory in our project. You can whether download from [this link](http://download.tensorflow.org/data/speech_commands_v0.01.tar.gz) (~1GB) or from R with:

```{r}
dir.create("data")

download.file(
  url = "http://download.tensorflow.org/data/speech_commands_v0.01.tar.gz", 
  destfile = "data/speech_commands_v0.01.tar.gz"
)

untar("data/speech_commands_v0.01.tar.gz", exdir = "data/speech_commands_v0.01")
```

Inside the `data` directory we will have a folder called `speech_commands_v0.01`. The WAV audio files inside this directory are organised in sub-folders with the label names. For example, all one-second audio files of people speaking the word "bed" are inside the `bed` directory. There are 30 of them and a special one called `_background_noise_` which contains background noises that could be mixed in to simulate background noise.

## Importing

In this step we will list all audio .wav files into a `tibble` with 3 columns: 

* `fname`: the file name;
* `class`: the label for each audio file;
* `class_id`: a unique integer number starting from zero for each class - used to one-hot encode the classes.

This will be useful to the next step when we will create a generator using the `tfdatasets` package.

```{r}
library(stringr)
library(dplyr)

files <- fs::dir_ls(
  path = "data/speech_commands_v0.01/", 
  recurse = TRUE, 
  glob = "*.wav"
)

files <- files[!str_detect(files, "background_noise")]

df <- tibble(
  fname = files, 
  class = fname %>% str_extract("1/.*/") %>% 
    str_replace_all("1/", "") %>%
    str_replace_all("/", ""),
  class_id = class %>% as.factor() %>% as.integer() - 1L
)
```

## Generator

We will now create our `Dataset`, which in the context of `tfdatasets`, adds operations to the TensorFlow graph in order to read and pre-process data. Since they are TensorFlow ops, they are executed in C++ and in parallel with model training.

The generator we will create will be responsible for reading the audio files from disk, creating the spectrogram for each one and batching the outputs.

Let's start defining creating the dataset from slices of the `data.frame` with audio file names and classes we just created.

```{r}
library(tfdatasets)
ds <- tensor_slices_dataset(df) 
```

Now, let's define the parameters for the spectrogram creation. We need to define the `window_size_ms` which is the size in milliseconds of each chunk we will break the audio wave; the `window_stride_ms`: the distance between the center of adjacent chunks; 

```{r}
window_size_ms <- 30
window_stride_ms <- 10
```

Now we will convert the window size and stride from milliseconds to samples. We are considering that our audio files have 16,000 samples per second (1000 ms). 

```{r}
window_size <- as.integer(16000*window_size_ms/1000)
stride <- as.integer(16000*window_stride_ms/1000)
```

We will obtain other quantities that will be usefull for the spectrogram creation like the number of chunks and the FFT size, ie. the number of bins the frequency axis. The function we are going to use to compute the spectrogram doesn't allow us to change the FFT size and uses by default the first superior power of 2 of the window size.

```{r}
fft_size <- as.integer(2^trunc(log(window_size, 2)) + 1)
n_chunks <- length(seq(window_size/2, 16000 - window_size/2, stride))
```

We will now use `dataset_map` which allows us to specify a pre-processing function for each observation (line) of our dataset. It's in this step that we read the raw audio file from disk and create it's spectrogram and the one-hot encoded response vector.

```{r}
ds <- ds %>%
  dataset_map(function(obs) {
    
    # a good way to debug when building tfdatsets pipelines is to use a print
    # statement like this:
    # print(str(obs))
    
    # decoding wav files
    audio_binary <- tf$io$read_file(tf$reshape(obs$fname, shape = list()))
    wav <- tf$audio$decode_wav(audio_binary, desired_channels = 1)
    samples <- wav$audio
    samples <- samples %>% tf$transpose(perm = c(1L, 0L))
    
    # create the spectrogram
    spectrogram <- tf$signal$stft(samples,
                                  frame_length = as.integer(window_size),
                                  frame_step = as.integer(stride))
    
    spectrogram <- tf$math$log(tf$abs(spectrogram) + 0.01)
    spectrogram <- tf$transpose(spectrogram, perm = c(1L, 2L, 0L))
    
    # normalization
    spectrogram <- tf$log(tf$abs(spectrogram) + 0.01)
    
    # moving channels to last dim
    spectrogram <- tf$transpose(spectrogram, perm = c(1L, 2L, 0L))
    
    # transform the class_id into a one-hot encoded vector
    response <- tf$one_hot(obs$class_id, 30L)
    
    list(spectrogram, response)
  }) 
```

Now, we will specify how we want batch observations from the dataset. We used `dataset_shuffle` since we want to shuffle observations from the dataset, otherwise it would follow the order of the `df` object. Then we used `dataset_repeat` in order to tell TensorFlow that we want to keep taking observations from the dataset even if all observations were already used. And most importantly here, we use `dataset_padded_batch` to specify that we want batches of size 32, but they should be padded, ie. if some observation has a different size we pad it with zeroes. The padded shapes is passed to `dataset_padded_batch` via the `padded_shapes` argument and we use `NULL` to state that this dimension doesn't need to be padded.

```{r}
ds <- ds %>% 
  dataset_shuffle(buffer_size = 100) %>%
  dataset_repeat() %>%
  dataset_padded_batch(
    batch_size = 32, 
    padded_shapes = list(
      shape(n_chunks, fft_size, NULL), 
      shape(NULL)
    )
  )
```

This is our Dataset specification, but we would need to rewrite all the code for the validation data, so it's a good practice to wrap this into a function of the data and other important parameters like the `window_size_ms` and `window_stride_ms`. Below, we will define a function called `data_geneartor` that will create the generator depending on those inputs.

```{r}
data_generator <- function(df, batch_size, shuffle = TRUE, 
                           window_size_ms = 30, window_stride_ms = 10) {
  
  window_size <- as.integer(16000*window_size_ms/1000)
  stride <- as.integer(16000*window_stride_ms/1000)
  fft_size <- as.integer(2^trunc(log(window_size, 2)) + 1)
  n_chunks <- length(seq(window_size/2, 16000 - window_size/2, stride))
  
  ds <- tensor_slices_dataset(df)
  
  if (shuffle) 
    ds <- ds %>% dataset_shuffle(buffer_size = 100)  
  
  ds <- ds %>%
    dataset_map(function(obs) {
      
      # decoding wav files
      audio_binary <- tf$io$read_file(tf$reshape(obs$fname, shape = list()))
      wav <- tf$audio$decode_wav(audio_binary, desired_channels = 1)
      samples <- wav$audio
      samples <- samples %>% tf$transpose(perm = c(1L, 0L))
      
      # create the spectrogram
      spectrogram <- tf$signal$stft(samples,
                                    frame_length = as.integer(window_size),
                                    frame_step = as.integer(stride))
      
      spectrogram <- tf$math$log(tf$abs(spectrogram) + 0.01)
      spectrogram <- tf$transpose(spectrogram, perm = c(1L, 2L, 0L))
      
      # transform the class_id into a one-hot encoded vector
      response <- tf$one_hot(obs$class_id, 30L)
      
      list(spectrogram, response)
    }) %>%
    dataset_repeat()
  
  ds <- ds %>% 
    dataset_padded_batch(batch_size, list(shape(n_chunks, fft_size, NULL), shape(NULL)))
  
  ds
}
```

Now, we can define training and validation data generators. It's worth noting that executing this won't actually compute any spectrogram and read any file. It will only define in the TensorFlow graph how it should read and pre-process data.

```{r}
set.seed(6)
id_train <- sample(nrow(df), size = 0.7*nrow(df))

ds_train <- data_generator(
  df[id_train,], 
  batch_size = 32, 
  window_size_ms = 30, 
  window_stride_ms = 10
)
ds_test <- data_generator(
  df[-id_train,], 
  batch_size = 32, 
  shuffle = FALSE, 
  window_size_ms = 30, 
  window_stride_ms = 10
)
```


## Model definition

Now that we know how we will feed our data we can focus on the model definition. The spectrogram can be treated like an image, so architectures that are commonly used in image recognition tasks should work well with the spectrograms too. 

We will build a convolutional neural network similar to what we have built [here](https://keras.rstudio.com/articles/examples/mnist_cnn.html) for the MNIST dataset.

The input size is defined by the number of chunks and the FFT size. Like we explained earlier, they can be obtained from the `window_size_ms` and `window_stride_ms` used to generate the spectrogram.

```{r}
window_size <- as.integer(16000*window_size_ms/1000)
stride <- as.integer(16000*window_stride_ms/1000)
fft_size <- as.integer(2^trunc(log(window_size, 2)) + 1)
n_chunks <- length(seq(window_size/2, 16000 - window_size/2, stride))
```

We will now define our model using the Keras sequential API:

```{r}
library(keras)
model <- keras_model_sequential()
model %>%  
  layer_conv_2d(input_shape = c(n_chunks, fft_size, 1), 
                filters = 32, kernel_size = c(3,3), activation = 'relu') %>% 
  layer_max_pooling_2d(pool_size = c(2, 2)) %>% 
  layer_conv_2d(filters = 64, kernel_size = c(3,3), activation = 'relu') %>% 
  layer_max_pooling_2d(pool_size = c(2, 2)) %>% 
  layer_conv_2d(filters = 128, kernel_size = c(3,3), activation = 'relu') %>% 
  layer_max_pooling_2d(pool_size = c(2, 2)) %>% 
  layer_conv_2d(filters = 256, kernel_size = c(3,3), activation = 'relu') %>% 
  layer_max_pooling_2d(pool_size = c(2, 2)) %>% 
  layer_dropout(rate = 0.25) %>% 
  layer_flatten() %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 128, activation = 'relu') %>% 
  layer_dropout(rate = 0.5) %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 30, activation = 'softmax')
```

We used 4 layers of convolutions combined with max pooling layers to extract features from the spectrogram images and 2 dense layers at the top. Our network is comparatevely simple when compared to more advanced archutectures like VGG and DenseNets that perform very well on image recognition tasks.

Now let's compile our model. We will use the categorical crossentropy as the loss function and use the Adadelta optimizer. It's also here that we define that we will look at the accuracy metric during training.

```{r}
model %>% compile(
  loss = loss_categorical_crossentropy,
  optimizer = optimizer_adadelta(),
  metrics = c('accuracy')
)
```

## Model fitting

Now, we will fit our model. In Keras we can use TensorFlow Datasets as inputs to the the `fit_generator` function and we will will do it here.

```{r}
model %>% fit_generator(
  generator = ds_train,
  steps_per_epoch = 0.7*nrow(df)/32,
  epochs = 10, 
  validation_data = ds_test, 
  validation_steps = 0.3*nrow(df)/32
)
```

```

```

The model accuracy was 93.23%. Let's learn how to make predictions and take a look at the confusion matrix.

## Making predictions

We can use the`predict_generator` function to make predictions to a new dataset. Let's make predictions for our test dataset.
The `predict_generator` function needs a step argument which is the number of times the generator will be called.

We can calculate the number of steps by knowing the batch size, and the size of the test dataset. 

```{r}
df_test <- df[-id_train,]
n_steps <- nrow(df_test)/32 + 1
```

We can then use the `predict_generator` function:

```{r}
predictions <- predict_generator(
  model, 
  ds_test, 
  steps = n_steps
)
str(predictions)
```

```
num [1:19424, 1:30] 1.22e-13 7.30e-19 5.29e-10 6.66e-22 1.12e-17 ...
```

This will output a matrix with 30 columns - one for each word and n_steps*batch_size number of rows. Note that it starts repeating the dataset at the end to create a full batch.

We can compute the predicted class by taking the column with the the greater probability, for example.

```{r}
classes <- apply(predictions, 1, which.max) - 1
```

A nice visualization of the confusion matrix is to create an alluvial diagram:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(alluvial)
x <- df_test %>%
  mutate(pred_class_id = head(classes, nrow(df_test))) %>%
  left_join(
    df_test %>% distinct(class_id, class) %>% rename(pred_class = class),
    by = c("pred_class_id" = "class_id")
  ) %>%
  mutate(correct = pred_class == class) %>%
  count(pred_class, class, correct)

alluvial(
  x %>% select(class, pred_class),
  freq = x$n,
  col = ifelse(x$correct, "lightblue", "red"),
  border = ifelse(x$correct, "lightblue", "red"),
  alpha = 0.6,
  hide = x$n < 20
)
```

![Alluvial Plot](plots/alluvial.png)

We can see from the diagram that the most relevant mistake our model makes is to classify "tree" as "three". There are other common errors like classifying "go" and "no", "up" as "off". With 93% of accuracy and considering the errors we can say that this model is pretty reasonable.

The saved model ocuppies 25Mb in disk, which is reasonable for a desktop but may not be for using in small devices. We could train a smaller model, with less layers, and see how much the performance decreases.

In speech recognition tasks it's also common to do some kind of data augmentation by mixing a background noise to the spoken audio making it more usefull for real applications where it's common to have other irrelevant sounds happening in the environment.
